Control your computer with your head and eyes. Nothing more, nothing less.

This is a program created by Antonio Dom√®nech and Daniela Tarzia. We dedicated our free time to develop this application for anyone who needs it or just wants to have some fun. We've put a lot on effort on it and our main goal is to make it accessible to people with disabilities that really need it

This program works on any computer with a 720p quality camera and we want it to be absolutely free. It has its one instructions ones you start it.

We really hope this program helps.

Thanks a lot!

Antonio and Daniela
